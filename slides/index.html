              Events that happen over time that we can't predict. This is very common in the browser because it's an asynchronous environment. If we examine a Drupal request we find that the exeuction path is more o less predictible (complex but predictible), and data is available when needed (when a database query is done we asume that result, success or failure, is available in the next line of code, the same for reading a file). In browser this is not true. We don't know when many operations will return their data: AJAX operations are the main example, but it's the same for workers, for example. User interaction, WebSockets, timers and animations are other sources of asynchronicity.

          <ul>
            <li>They are resolved only once: they return a single value.</li>
            <li>Following the execution flow may not be trivial.</li>
            <li>They are not lazy.</li>
            <li>They are not cancelables.</li>

          <aside class="notes">
          <ul>
            <li>If you want to repeat an action you must run the code that makes the action and processes the response of the promise again. Usually you can do it calling again the function that manages this, so it's not a big deal.. But you'll need to control this re-execution process.<br>
            This works well for managing setTimeouts or simple HTTP request responses, but falls short when dealing with setInterval or WebSockets, for example. Once the promise has been fullfilled no longer returns values. Get more info about this here: <a href="https://medium.com/@mpodlasin/promises-vs-observables-4c123c51fe13">Promises vs Observables</a>, by Mateusz Podlasin.</li>
            <li>See article by Nolan Lawson, PouchDB core team developer: <a href="https://pouchdb.com/2015/05/18/we-have-a-problem-with-promises.html">We have a problem with promises</a></li>
            <li>As the promise is created the code that tries to solve it is executed immediately. It is assumed that the answer is needed now.</li>
            <li>Except using some libraries like Bluebird, once the promise is created it will try to resolve or fail, but it cannot be cancelled (although it can be ignored, of course). This can result in wasted resources.</li>

          This is an example of a very simple data path, the simplest of all. An event is generated in the browser, which is captured and the appropriate action is taken, in this case showing an element of the DOM. There we see a flow of data that goes from the broadcast of the event to its reception in the listener. Nothing mysterious, we do it every day.

          <aside class="notes">
          Pipes with transformations are the interesting ones. For example, the transition from one click to a list of objects loaded from a service. At some point the user clicks a button. This click becomes a URL that serves, for example, a competitions's classification  data list: athletes, points obtained, nationality, name, etc. That URL then becomes the data contained in that URL, which will be a JSON. Following that the JSON content is transformed into instances of a custom class that contains the data received. Lastly, the final action occurs, which is to assign these objects to an internal variable. If we use an Angular framework, it will happily paint those objects on the screen once they are assigned to the variable.

          So, the initial data, a click, has travelled a pipe that has been transforming that data, until the final action, the assignment to a variable. This is nothing new, it's done all the time using callbacks or promises. We could chain the output of one calling to another, and deal with the complexity that is produced. The good thing of Reactive Programming is how easy is to define this data management, using those defined pipes, creating that plumbing system.

          <br>

          <strong>Well, now we have to take a deep breath to get into the thick part of the talk. How do we create these data pipes? How do we declare the reactions to change?</strong>

            Visualizing how data traverses the pipe is very important to understand what is happening. Marble diagrams were designed for this purpose. They are read from left to right, representing time. Each ball is a value emitted by the Observable. The vertical line indicates that the flow has ended, and the cross indicates that it has emitted an error. In both cases the flow is closed.

            The second fundamental part is the operators. In the previous diagram they would be the boxes. It is what allows data to be transformed, in more or less complex ways, but it also allows flows to be modulated (for example, preventing data from passing if it does not meet certain condition). They also serve to create Observables (for example, to create an Observable from an event of the DOM, so that when that event occurs the Observable emits the event).

          </div>
         <ul>
            <li>You can express from simple reactions to extremely complex reactions to change.</li>
            <li>No more hells.</li>
            <li>Observables <i>resolve</i> as many times as needed.</li>
            <li>Execution flow is intuitive <sup>*</sup>.</li>
            <li>It's lazy.</li>
            <li>It's cancellable.</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
          <ul>
            <li>Callbacks only express simple reactons.</Li>
            <li>Reactive Programming is not about nesting code.</Li>
            <li>Observables emmit values, not just one.</Li>
            <li>Just read the pipe! For complex pipes is not so obvious, but I bet it would be worse with promises. Of course you have to be used to operators.</Li>
            <li>And could be not lazy</Li>

            <span>When to use Reactive Programming?</span>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>With many ashynchonous data sources.</li>
            <li>Complex interactions.</li>
            <li>Complex interdependency.</li>
            <li>To avoid internal state to manage asynchronous events.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>Because with Reactive Programming is easier to manage many data sources.</li>
              <li>Because it's easy to program complex interactions with Reactive Programing plumbing</li>
              <li>Same as before: plumbing makes those things easy.</li>
              <li>Reactive Programming can help to remove some internal states because that functionality is done by operators and Observables. Remember the button killer example? Doing that with promises or callbacks would need some timers and keeping some internal state.</li>

              <li>You see three dropdowns, each is dependant on previous: if you change, the next dropdowns change.</li>
              <li>Data is not just retrieved from and endpoint, we need some previous data to render dropdowns (identifiers, labels, etc), so we have dependant data. You could argue that API should be simpler to use and I would agree, but it wasn't the case and we had to stick to already existent API.</li>
              <li>Data is refreshed, sometimes very often. While this view is pretty static, the underlaying library that access API is prepared to refresh data automatically and on demand. This would affect the displayed data. <br>App should work offline, so library builds a local data repository with the fetched data, requesting fresh data when it's outdated.</li>
              <li>This resulted in a pretty asynchronous hell. We worked on this with AngularJS without reactive programming: we lost some mental health those days. Then we did it again with Angular using Reactive Programming, and although it was hard because we had to learn how to use it, the asynchronous hell just became a complex but funny problem to solve.</li>
